# SilentAssassin

Silent Assassin is a location based cat and mouse game. Players are given a choice of being an assassin or an explorer. 

## Explorers
The explorer's job is to start quests and collect artifacts to earn points, while avoiding being in the same place as an assassin.

## Assassins
The assassin's job is to predict and locate where explorers may be. If they are in the same place as an explorer, the assassins can try and kill anyone that is in the area. If there is an explorer present, they are killed and their score resets to 0.
